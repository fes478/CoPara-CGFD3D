## Description

This is a strong ground motion simulation program suitable for multi-GPU platform with the computing capability greater than 6.0.

It can address elastic wave propagating issues in three-dimensional complex media with undulating surfaces.

It was first proposed by Zhang and Chen (2006), added PML absorbing boundary by  Zhang and Shen (2010), improved by Zhang et al. (2012), and applied in many historical earthquake studies.

Here is a new multi-GPU-based collaborative parallel implementation.
